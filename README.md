Project developed with Diogo Valente, João Afonso Pereira, Maria Loureiro, and Maria Carvalho, in the context of Eurekathon 2021, in which we achieved the **1st place**. 

Data-driven and case-study competition (3rd Edition), this time on **Sustainable Mobility in Matosinhos City**.

Our winning solution answered to the question: _How to promote Matosinhos' transition to micromobility, towards decarbonization?_The proposed solution included 3 dimensions, focused both on **supply and demand**:

* user encouragement
* effective targeting of communication strategies
* fleet optimization.

For that, predictive and prescriptive models were trained with **big data**, provided by CEiiA and Câmara Municipal de Matosinhos, social partners of the competition.

The estimated **impact** of the proposed solution was an additional saving of 73 tons of emitted CO2 per year
